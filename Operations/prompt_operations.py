skills_prompt = "You are an AI assistant tasked with optimizing a resume based on a specific job description. Your goal is to identify the most relevant skills and technologies from the job description and suggest an updated list of skills that will increase the applicant's chances of getting noticed.\n\nYou will be provided with two inputs:\n1. The applicant's current skills in JSON format\n2. The job description\n\nFirst, here are the applicant's current skills:\n<current_skills>\n{{CURRENT_SKILLS}}\n</current_skills>\n\nNow, here is the job description:\n<job_description>\n{{JOB_DESCRIPTION}}\n</job_description>\n\nPlease follow these steps:\n\n1. Carefully analyze the job description, paying close attention to all mentioned skills, technologies, and requirements.\n\n2. Identify the key skills and technologies that are explicitly mentioned or implied in the job description. Consider both technical skills and soft skills.\n\n3. Create a new list of skills that combines the most relevant skills from the applicant's current list and the key skills identified from the job description. This new list should be tailored to maximize the applicant's appeal for this specific job.\n\n4. Organize the new list of skills into the same categories as the original list: \"Programming Language\", \"Frameworks and Databases\", \"Cloud Technologies\", and \"Other Technologies\".\n\n5. For each category, select up to 7 skills or technologies that you believe will create the highest impact. Prioritize skills that are directly mentioned in the job description or closely related to the required skills.\n\n6. If a category lacks relevant skills from either the current skills or the job description, you may suggest skills and technologies that you think will create a high impact based on the overall requirements of the job.\n\n7. Format your output as a JSON object, following the same structure as the input skills list.\n\nHere's an example of how your output should be structured:\n\n{\n  \"skills\": [\n    \"Programming Language: Skill1, Skill2, Skill3, Skill4, Skill5, Skill6, Skill7\",\n    \"Frameworks and Databases: Skill1, Skill2, Skill3, Skill4, Skill5, Skill6, Skill7\",\n    \"Cloud Technologies: Skill1, Skill2, Skill3, Skill4, Skill5, Skill6, Skill7\",\n    \"Other Technologies: Skill1, Skill2, Skill3, Skill4, Skill5, Skill6, Skill7\"\n  ]\n}\n\nRemember to include only the most relevant and impactful skills for this specific job opportunity. Your goal is to create a tailored list that will significantly improve the applicant's chances of getting noticed by the employer.\n\nProvide your response as a valid JSON object, without any additional explanation or commentary."
exp_prompt = "You are an AI assistant tasked with helping a job applicant modify their experiences to better align with a specific job description. Your goal is to enhance the applicant's chances of securing an interview by tailoring their experiences to match the key responsibilities and qualifications outlined in the job description.\n\nFirst, carefully review the applicant's original experiences:\n\n<original_experiences>\n{{ORIGINAL_EXPERIENCES}}\n</original_experiences>\n\nNext, thoroughly analyze the job description:\n\n<job_description>\n{{JOB_DESCRIPTION}}\n</job_description>\n\nNow, follow these steps to modify the experiences:\n\n1. Analyze the job description:\n   - Identify key skills, technologies, and responsibilities mentioned\n   - Note specific qualifications and experience requirements\n   - Recognize any unique aspects or priorities of the role\n\n2. For each experience in the original list:\n   - Modify the description points to align more closely with the job requirements\n   - Ensure that the modifications are realistic and based on the original experience\n   - Maintain the same number of experiences and description points as in the original\n\n3. When modifying experiences:\n   - Quantify impacts wherever possible (e.g., percentage improvements, time saved)\n   - Use strong action verbs to begin each description point\n   - Highlight complexity and challenges overcome in projects or tasks\n   - Incorporate relevant technologies and skills mentioned in the job description\n   - Focus on achievements that demonstrate qualifications for the new role\n\n4. If necessary, create new experiences that are more impactful and relevant to the job description, while maintaining the overall structure of the original experiences (same number of companies and description points per experience).\n\n5. Ensure that the modified experiences cover as many key aspects of the job description as possible, including:\n   - Software development lifecycle and Agile methodologies\n   - Full-stack development, especially Python and TypeScript (React)\n   - CI/CD systems, particularly GitLab\n   - Cloud-native microservices in AWS, including serverless technologies\n   - Infrastructure as Code, specifically Terraform\n   - Developer productivity and internal tooling\n\nOutput the modified experiences in the exact same format as the input, maintaining the JSON structure:\n    {\n        \"title\": \"[same Title as given to you]\",\n        \"company\": \"[same Company Name as given to you]\",\n        \"location\": \"[Same Location as given to you]\",\n        \"duration\": \"[Same Duration as given to you]\",\n        \"description\": [\n            \"[Modified description point 1]\",\n            \"[Modified description point 2]\",\n            \"[Modified description point 3]\",\n            \"[Modified description point 4 (if applicable)]\"\n        ]\n    }\n\nRemember:\n1. Quantify impacts wherever possible\n2. Use strong action verbs\n3. Explain complexity and challenges faced\n4. Maintain the same number of experiences and description points as the original\n5. Ensure all modifications are realistic and based on the original experiences\n6. Tailor the experiences to closely match the job description requirements\n7. If the experiences have 3 points in the description then I want the same number of description points in the output\n8. Do Not Change the Title or company or location or duration.\n9. Each Description point should be of 2 lines at max.\n9. The output should only consists of Json Structure as described nothing else."
summary_prompt = "You are tasked with generating a concise and impactful professional summary based on the following information:\n\n<skills>\n{{SKILLS}}\n</skills>\n\n<experiences>\n{{EXPERIENCES}}\n</experiences>\n\n<job_description>\n{{JOB_DESCRIPTION}}\n</job_description>\n\nYour task is to create a stellar, impactful, and concise summary of 2-4 sentences that highlights the candidate's qualifications for the job described. Follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total years of experience by carefully analyzing the information provided in the experiences section and do ceil of total experiences. Sum up the duration of all relevant positions.\n\n2. Identify and list all relevant skills and technologies mentioned in both the experiences and job description sections. Pay special attention to matching skills between the candidate's experience and the job requirements.\n\n3. Craft a summary using strong action verbs and quantify impacts where possible. The summary should:\n   - Mention the total years of experience\n   - Highlight the most relevant skills and technologies\n   - Showcase the candidate's most significant achievements or qualifications\n   - Align the candidate's experience with the job requirements\n\n4. Ensure the summary is between 2-4 sentences long and maintains a professional tone.\n\n5. Format your output as a JSON object with a single key \"summary\" whose value is the generated summary.\n\nExample output format:\n{\n  \"summary\": \"Your generated summary goes here.\"\n}\n\nRemember to focus solely on creating the summary.
